# Analyzing news headlines with spaCy

We take a dataset of [Reuters news headlines](https://www.kaggle.com/notlucasp/financial-news-headlines)
and use [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) to extract named entities.
We query the results for the organisations most often in the news,
and examine their occurrence over time.

Necessary libraries are installed inline in the single Jupyter
notebook in this repo: `who-is-in-the-news.ipynb`.
